**Abstract**

In this research, I use artificial intelligence (AI) to show which socio-economic indicators are highly correlated to progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I did this to assist policy makers and government officials make data based decisions and identify policies they could enact or steps to take to make their countries more sustainable and more developed. By training a fully-connected neural network with World Bank socio-economic indicators against SDG scores from the SDG Index, I was able to establish that certain socio-economic indicators such as domestic credit to the private sector and employment of females in industry are highly correlated to the achievement of high SDG levels in a country. Although this is an important step forward toward generating objective guidance on what works in the achievement of the Goals, it is clear that future research is needed in order to further establish the causation relationships between social-economic indicators and SDGs.
